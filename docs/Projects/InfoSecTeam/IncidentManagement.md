In Glasswall we have a strong culture of incident management and incident reporting, we know that is important to protect the organization from the impacts of security incidents (theft, breaches, ransomware...). 
In InfoSec we have a structured and algorithmic way of dealing with incidents
There is a trained  Incident Response team  from InfoSec available and all the teams in Glasswall can reach out to us if needed. We are constantly trying to improve and automate our processes and any feedback from other teams is welcome.


## How we manage incidents 
- Alerting from cloud Systems (Azure and AWS)
- Incident Playbooks (Jira)
- Graphs and timelines (Jira)
- Indentifying Vulnerabilities – Risks – Security Controls from incidents
- Incident Reports (Automated from Jira)
